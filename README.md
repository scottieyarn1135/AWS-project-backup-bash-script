# AWS-project-backup-bash-script
I am currently using to make sure that my projects files are up to date.

I am currently learning bash scripting so I decided to make a small project that I will be using.

This is currently a script that uses aws cli to upload the files to an S3 bucket - This is so that in the case where I want to change distros I can use this script to make sure that the files are up to date.

I can also schedule this task to run once a week so that it is automated.
